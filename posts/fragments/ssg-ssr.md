Yesterday, I [tweeted about](https://twitter.com/brandur/status/1494025314342637568) how we're finding Sentry spans to be pretty useful for analyzing performance problems. Here's a little addition I put into prod today -- nothing mind-blowing, but useful.

Sentry has a built-in sampling concept, with the idea is that when you're using spans for aggregate analysis, you only need a small subset for them to be useful. We've had our sampling rate cranked to 1.0 for a while, which is somewhat wasteful, but allows us to emit a `sentry_trace_url` to our [canonical log line](/nanoglyphs/025-logs#canonical-log-lines-2) so that you can click through to visualize any request that goes to the API.

The downside is that as our API traffic's increased over the last few months, we've had to bump our limits with Sentry to prevent it from discarding requests. A few extra bugs their way isn't a big deal, but we find that request tracing to be a technology that's really useful once in a while, with no one looking at it 99% of the time. Logs are used overwhelmingly more commonly used for observing production.

In addition to a sampling rate, Sentry's SDKs also provide a sampling _function_ to specify custom sampling logic. I made the minor logical step that most of our API traffic is bot-related stuff that no one is _ever_ going to look at. In particular for us, we have a lot of traffic going to our health endpoint as an uptime service monitors us.

Plugging in a function to ignore that health endpoint took almost no time at all:

```go
{
    ...

    if err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
        Dsn:         dsn,
        Environment: environment,
        TracesSampler: sentry.TracesSamplerFunc(func(samplingContext sentry.SamplingContext) sentry.Sampled {
            return tracesSampler(samplingContext.Span.Context())
        }),

    ...
}

func tracesSampler(ctx context.Context) sentry.Sampled {
    // Always sample all requests unless it's a path that we
    // explicitly skip.
    if requestInfo, ok := requestinfo.FromContext(ctx); ok {
        if !isRequestSampled(requestInfo.Method, requestInfo.URL.Path) {
            return sentry.SampledFalse
        }

        return sentry.SampledTrue
    }

    // Skip any orphan spans that occurred outside of a request.
    return sentry.SampledFalse
}

func isRequestSampled(method, path string) bool {
    if method == http.MethodGet && path == "/healthz" {
        return false
    }

    return true
}
```

Alternatively, we could also have randomized it so as to still sample this endpoint occasionally, but at a much lower rate than most of the API. This would keep Sentry's aggregate analysis features for the health endpoint still useful.

We're currently sending ~350k spans to Sentry a month, and I expect this simple change will wipe out about half of them. For now, we only exclude the health endpoint, but I expect we'll expand the list in the future. Other exclusion ideas:

- `404` spam from probes looking for open WordPress installations and the like.
- Misauthentications (`401`s) caused by bots.
- Rate limited requests.
- It might actually be a good idea to omit all `4xx` requests because they'll tell you far less about an endpoint's performance characteristics than successful ones.
